Project logs:
Project Summary: "A cloud based retail analytics and forecasting system, it utilized most the data science and ml concept including eda, dataset, azure, sql, github, algorithams, etc"

First of all i create an azure account, and thank god i had the student id from my university and student email i used it to create a free azure student account that initally offers $100 free credits for 365 days and also it offers some additional free azure cloud services as well.
Then i installed azure cli in my macOS terminal so i can manage the azure account from my MacOs terminal. I used the "brew update && brew install azure-cli" command to install the azure cli, and then using "az login" command i logged into my account and i had only 1 subscription in my account but still i usd  --subscription commant to set my current working subscripton for this project for a safe side., then i made a working direcotory for ths project using mkdir command and then started working on this directory on my MacOS
I also initlize git into my project so i can utilize github version control system

My next task was to create an virtual envorioment or resources in azure account for my cloud retail insights with some variable names and tags.

i used series of command for this; first of all i made sure the azure account is logged in if not hen i logged in using az login:
the commands for resource creation were:
REGION="centralindia" i choose the physical location of my azure cloud services i choose the central india over uaenorth because it cheaper (as i am a student cant afford expensive one :D)
although the uaenorth server is quite fast
PROJECT="retail-analytics" to initlize the project roots (naming)
then i used 
ENV="dev"
RG="rg-$PROJECT-$ENV" so after using this command my final name becoems
rg-retail-analytics-dev becuase it feteched the variable values of
PROJECT and ENV
we defined the EVN so later we can working without collision between dev/prod
STORAGE="stretaildev" command was useed to name my storage account it will be used to hold my preproceesed and proccesd data (csv etc)
SQLSERVER="sqlsrv-retail-dev" 
SQLDB="sqldb-retail-dev"

these two commands were used to create an Azure SQL server and it contqinas a azure sql database named "sqldb-retail-dev"

DATAFACTORY="df-retail-dev"
 to create a datafactory to move data from Blob to SQL etc.
 to make a Azure Databrcks an pachae spark worspace was created using command "DATABRICKS="dbw-retail-dev"
"
it is big data friendly and calable data processing + feature enginering + model training (Spark MLib or PySpark + scikit-learn)
a key vault was created to store the sql database credentails, connection string, api keys etc, so my app can directly read secrets from here instead of hardcoding them in pythong command used ="KEYVAULT="kv-retail-dev"

I have also create an azure machine learning workspace to track ecperiments, register models, and deploy my trained model here as a REST API

I also used tags for resoruces by using following commands in series:
TAG_ENV="env=$ENV"
TAG_OWNER="owner=haseeb"
TAG_PROJECT="project=$PROJECT"
TAG_CC="cost-center=personal"

tags are very useful for a proper organization, cost tracking, automation, and filtering based on the owner and env

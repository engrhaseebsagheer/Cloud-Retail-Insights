| ~~Databricks Workspace~~    | dbw-retail-dev (dropped) | Removed due to CPU quota restrictions on student account |

## Region Choice

**Selected Region:** `centralindia`
**Reasoning:**

* Cheaper pricing compared to `uaenorth` (important for student subscription credits).
* Still offers required services (Blob, SQL, ADF, AML).
* Latency is acceptable for project workload.

---

## Tag Structure

Applied consistently across resources for organization, cost tracking, and automation:

```
env=dev
owner=haseeb
project=retail-analytics
cost-center=personal
```

## Free-Tier Notes

* **Subscription:** Azure for Students
* **Credits:** \$100 free credits valid for 365 days.
* **Additional Free Services:** Certain SKUs and quotas for Azure SQL, App Service, and Blob Storage (within free tier limits).
* **Limits & Restrictions:**

  * Some advanced features (e.g., Key Vault secrets, higher CPU quotas) unavailable.
  * Databricks cannot be used due to CPU quota restrictions.
  * Limited VM sizes and premium SKUs.
* **Cost Control Practices:**

  * Stop App Service when idle.
  * Use smallest possible SKUs for dev.
  * Prefer SQL-based processing instead of Databricks (quota limitation workaround).

---

## Notes

* Resource names follow the pattern: `<resource-type>-<project-name>-<env>`.
* Environment separation (`dev`, later `prod`) avoids collisions.
* Secrets and credentials are stored locally in `.env` (gitignored) due to Key Vault restrictions.
* Architecture updated to use **Azure SQL + Python notebooks** for data processing instead of Databricks.

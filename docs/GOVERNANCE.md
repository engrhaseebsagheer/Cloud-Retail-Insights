## Region Choice
**Selected Region:** `centralindia`  
**Reasoning:**  
- Cheaper pricing compared to `uaenorth` (important for student subscription credits).  
- Still offers all required services (Blob, SQL, ADF, Databricks, AML).  
- Latency is acceptable for project work.

## Tag Structure
Tags applied to all resources for organization, cost tracking, and automation:
env=dev

## Free-Tier Notes
- **Subscription:** Azure for Students  
- **Credits:** $100 free credits valid for 365 days (started on account creation date).  
- **Additional Free Services:** Certain SKUs and quotas for services like Azure SQL, App Service, and Blob Storage (within free tier limits).  
- **Limits & Restrictions:**
  - No access to some admin-level features (e.g., full Key Vault management).
  - Some VM sizes and premium SKUs unavailable in free subscription.
- **Cost Control Practices:**
  - Stop Databricks clusters when not in use.
  - Stop App Service when idle.
  - Use the smallest possible SKUs for dev work and scale up only when needed.

## Notes
- Resource names follow the pattern: `<resource-type>-<project-name>-<env>`.
- Environment separation (`dev`, later `prod`) is built into naming to avoid collisions.
- Secrets and credentials are stored locally in `.env` (gitignored) due to Key Vault restrictions.
